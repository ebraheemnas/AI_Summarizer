    <h1>Summize</h1>

<p>Summize is an open-source article summarizer that simplifies your reading experience by transforming lengthy articles into clear and concise summaries. This project is still under development and is not yet ready for production use.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Summize uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze articles and extract the most important information. The summary is generated using a combination of extractive and abstractive summarization techniques.</p>

<p>Extractive summarization involves selecting the most important sentences or phrases from the article and presenting them in a summary. Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating a summary by understanding the article and creating new sentences that capture the essential information.</p>

<p>Summize uses a combination of these techniques to produce accurate and concise summaries of articles.</p>
